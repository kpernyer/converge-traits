//! Invariants — the engine's guarantee system.
//!
//! # Why invariants instead of validation functions?
//!
//! Converge doesn't have features — it has guarantees. Invariants are
//! those guarantees made executable. They run at specific phases of the
//! convergence loop and can block progress, reject results, or halt
//! the engine entirely.
//!
//! The three classes correspond to when guarantees are checked:
//! - **Structural**: every merge. Catches corruption immediately.
//! - **Semantic**: end of cycle. Ensures logical consistency.
//! - **Acceptance**: convergence claim. Final gate before results.

/// integrity). Others only matter at cycle boundaries (semantic consistency).
