//! Facts and proposed facts — the type boundary.
//!
//! This is the most important design decision in Converge: LLMs suggest,
//! the engine validates. `ProposedFact` is not `Fact`. There is no implicit
//! conversion between them.
//!
//! # Why two types?
//!
//! A `Fact` is an authoritative assertion in the context. It was either
//! provided by a human (seed), produced by a deterministic agent (policy,
//! optimizer), or explicitly promoted from a `ProposedFact` by a
//! `ValidationAgent`.
//!
//! A `ProposedFact` is a suggestion from a non-authoritative source (typically
//! an LLM). It lives in `ContextKey::Proposals` until validated. This
//! separation is what makes Converge trustworthy: you can always distinguish
//! between "an LLM said this" and "the system asserts this."
//!
//! # Security implications
//!
//! Any weakening of this boundary — implicit promotion, auto-validation,
//! or type coercion — is a correctness and security issue. Treat changes
//! to these types as requiring security review.
